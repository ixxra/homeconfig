##USAGE: 
#
# source anaconda
#
##ABOUT:
#
# this loads anaconda in your $PATH, so that your old python 
# can not be executed by default.
#
# The prompt is modified with a little snake, so you don't forget 
# the anaconda is in your PATH ;-)
#
# to restore your system, just run `escape_the_anaconda`
